# RTOS Task

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) to manage tasks in an embedded system. An RTOS allows for better task scheduling, resource management, and real-time performance.

## Features

- Task scheduling
- Inter-task communication
- Resource management
- Real-time performance

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone /home/kakashi/STM32CubeIDE/workspace_1.17.0/RTOS_Task
    ```

2. **Open the project in STM32CubeIDE:**
    - Launch STM32CubeIDE.
    - Navigate to `File > Open Projects from File System...`.
    - Select the cloned repository.

3. **Build the project:**
    - Click on the `Build` button in the toolbar or press `Ctrl+B`.

4. **Flash the firmware:**
    - Connect your STM32 board.
    - Click on the `Run` button or press `Ctrl+F11`.

## Usage

- **Task Creation:** Define tasks using the RTOS API and assign priorities.
- **Task Scheduling:** The RTOS scheduler will manage task execution based on priority and timing.
- **Inter-task Communication:** Use queues, semaphores, and mutexes for communication and synchronization between tasks.
- **Resource Management:** Efficiently manage CPU, memory, and peripherals using the RTOS.

## Benefits

- Improved task management
- Enhanced real-time performance
- Better resource utilization
- Simplified code maintenance
